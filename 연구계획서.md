Customer-centric Data-riven Marketing

Human-centered marketing approach that harnesses data & technology to deliver engaging experiences across each individual customer's decition journey

What: permanent data storage & analytics tool of digital footprint of all customers and prospects

Why: Limited tracking of media interactions

Augmented Analytics for Customer Experience — Uses machine learning (ML) to automate
data preparation, insight discovery, data science, and ML model development and insight
sharing, expanding insights by using AI to deliver analytics anywhere and for everyone in the
organization.

B2B sales and marketing — Advanced analytics with AI and ML are fueling technologies such as
lead scoring, predictive sales forecasting, voice-driven bots and ML algorithms to help drive sales
operational efficiency and effectiveness, and optimize sales outcomes such as revenue or profit
margins. Key investment drivers include improvements and innovations in the UX and end-user
engagement delivered through platforms, more integration, more adoption, and the application of
predictive/prescriptive analytic insights.
Innovation profiles include: predictive B2B marketing analytics, price optimization and management
for B2B, sales KPI analytics, sales performance management, sales predictive analytics, virtual
digital sales assistant

There is an AI “land grab” from large vendors making “big bets” and also from startups seeking to
gain a competitive edge. Both aim to support or replace manual human-based activities with
intelligent automation and improve decision making with insights and guided recommendations
using embedded machine learning and other advanced analytics. For example, the established
large enterprise software vendors are emphasizing sales, service, marketing, human resources and
ERP as particularly valuable areas for applying AI techniques.
Intelligent applications will use AI in the following ways:
■ Analytics: AI can be used to create more predictive and prescriptive analytics that can then be
presented to users for further evaluation, or plugged into a process to drive autonomous action.
AI is also being used for augmented analytics.
■ Process augmentation: AI can provide more intelligent actions for an application. For example,
you can use AI for intelligent invoice matching or analysis of incoming email to improve service
flow. In the future, this can be extended further to identify patterns of work, from which process
models can be built and executed.
■ User experience: Natural language processing used to create virtual assistants is one
application of AI to the user experience. Further examples include facial recognition and other
AI applications for understanding user emotions, context or intent, and predicting user needs.

User Advice: Enterprise application leaders should:
■ Explore how AI can improve your organization’s processes and operations by adding more
intelligent automation, dynamic workflows, and better decision making.
■ Challenge your packaged software providers to outline in their product roadmaps how they are
incorporating AI to add business value in the form of advanced analytics, intelligent processes
and advanced user experiences.
■ Be aware of “AI washing” as more and more startups, and even aging solutions, claim AI as part
of their solution. Ask them how they use AI to deliver advanced analytics, intelligent processes
and new user experiences.
■ Prioritize investments in highly specialized and domain-specific intelligent applications delivered
as individual-point solutions which help solve problem areas such as customer engagement and
service, talent acquisition, collaboration, engagement and more.
■ Understand how the vendor is mitigating bias in the models used in its application. Verify that
the vendor is safeguarding your data if used as part of a benchmarking service.

Business Impact: Intelligent enterprise applications that leverage AI can offer the following
benefits:
■ Reduce or eliminate human-based manual tasks allowing workers to focus on more valueadding
activities through the use of intelligent automation and insights — via bots, sensors and
machine learning.
■ Improve business efficiency via packaged AI technologies embedded in enterprise business
processes.
■ Make business operations more agile with business processes that adapt and reshape
themselves as they run.
For example, in the area of human capital management (HCM), AI is increasingly being added to
HCM applications to match talent supply and demand, predict recruitment success, or optimize
recruitment marketing. Predictors include whether a particular candidate is fit for a job, the
likelihood that a candidate would be open to exploring a new job opportunity, and behavioral
profiles through analysis of voice or video interviews. Candidate-facing chatbots are becoming
increasingly common in enabling further automation of this process, such as recommending which
jobs to apply for and answering questions or conducting initial candidate screening.
